# FIRE-DETECTION-THROUGH-SURVEILLANCE-VIDEOS-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
# Alternative title:
Action recognition in movie scenes using deep feature technologies
# Aim:
To efficient RCNN based system for fire detection in videos captured in uncertain
surveillance scenarios
# Synopsis:
Vision based fire detection framework has lately picked up popularity when contrasted
with customary fire recognition framework dependent on sensors. The need of video perception
at private, Modern, business regions and woods areas has expanded the use of vision based fire
acknowledgment system Recently lots of fire related accidents has occurred due to improper
Surveillance or unable to cover those uncertain regions like restricted areas in forest or any
factory buildings. In order to overcome such accidents , we propose a new method using
Convolutional neural networks (RCNN).
